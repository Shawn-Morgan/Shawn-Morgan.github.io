    <!--about Shawn-->
    <p>
        I was born in Houston, Texas and went to High School in Fort Bend ISD at Kempner High School. 
        I went to St Edward's University in Austin, TX where he played soccer and graducated wtih a degree in Business and Marketing. 

        After graduating, I started my career as an IT Project Manager for a small company called Waterfield Technologies in Tulsa, Ok.
        After 9 years, I moved back to Houston and worked for BP at the TX City Refinery for 2 years as an IT Facilities Provisioning Lead. 
        In 2008, I started working for Chevron Pipe Line Company as an IT Project Manager and moved into leadership positions as a Team Lead about 5 years ago. 
        I'm interested in becoming more technical since I have been in a Supervisor position for about 5 years so that I can pursue individual contributor roles again working closer with the business. 
        I also want to set a good software development and engineering foundation that would allow me to take up more Analytics positions. 

        I have a wife and 4 kids. All under age 11. 2 boys & 2 girls. And now live in Humble, TX.
